**I am a junior, majoring in Computer Science at the University of Mary Washington.**
**Basically, I belong to Pakistan and  have joined this college as a transfer student. Transferring from Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Pakistan  to University of Mary Washington, USA has been quite an exciting and challenging journey for me.**
**So far I have learnt C++, JAVA , Python , Flask and some other languages.**
**In this blog, I will outline some of the  cool things I learnt in the class of CPSC 350(Applications of databases)**
