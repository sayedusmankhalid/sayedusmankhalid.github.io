**Install PostgresSQL on Ubuntu**

Ubuntu's default repositories contain Postgres packages, so we can install them without a hassle using the apt packaging system.

Run following commands on the command line:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib 

Once the installation is complete you need to start the postgresql on your machine by typing the following command:

    sudo service postgresql start

  The installation procedure created a user account called postgres that is associated with the default Postgres role. In order to use Postgres, we'll need to log into that account. You can do that by typing:
   

    psql -U postgres -h localhost

Once you are in postgresql you can set the password to your postgres database by typing the following command: 

    \password postgres

I hope you find this information useful, go have fun with postgresql database
